Purpose 
Splunk is the enterprise log analytics and service insights platform that aggregates and analyzes logs and metrics from multiple data sources in AWS and on-prem. 

High-level objectives:

Deploy Splunk infrastructure in AWS to support searches and advanced log analytics across on-prem and AWS.

Develop end to end service health dashboards, glass tables to depict business workflow and alerts for real time monitoring using ITSI.

Integrate Splunk with data sources to consume logs and KPIs from all needed services used by the business-critical applications – CloudWatch, RDS, Lambda etc.

Send alerts from Splunk to enterprise monitoring backend for event correlation.

Solution 
Stand up a centralized platform in AWS 2.0 logging account for log analytics and end-to-end service health monitoring for applications and shared services across Fannie Mae’s on-premise and cloud environments.  Infosec and MARS Splunk clusters will be deployed in the same VPC within the Log Account using separate app short names. Initial deployment will be in DEV account and will be propagated to the higher environments during implementation stages (test/acpt/P2X/P2P).

Service Account Access Patterns


Splunk Local Users	Permissions
auto_on	
Search mars index
Modify roles and associate AD groups
Initiate Indexer and Search Head cluster updates
kinesis	
search aws_seq index 
ftadevl/ftaprod	NUID
Data Governance (required)
Information Classification: FM Internal
Crown Jewel: NA
SOX Relevance: No
Data ingested to Splunk is all operational logs and performance metrics. Application teams are responsible for masking and cleaning up any sensitive or NPI data before sending to CloudWatch/Splunk.

Enterprise Data Governance policy requirements are not applicable, as Splunk does not store or exchange any business data.  

Observability (required)
Splunk Monitoring Console (part of COTS) will monitor the availability of all Splunk components.
Splunk logs will be send to the respective Splunk clusters.
Catchpoint will monitor the URL availability of the nodes.
Security (required)
ISA Domains

Security Controls

Credential Management

Human Users -  Active Directory
Splunk Local Admin (break glass) - Create IAG identity and onboard to CyberArk  (evaluate CyberArk to change password on check-in)
Splunk Service Users - (accounts used for automation for Splunk processes- prevent interactive login through web console) - Create IAG identity and onboard to Secret Manager if password is needed.
NUIDs - AD accounts, password management (Secret Manager )
for running Splunk process (does not require password - via sudo)
AD bind NUID
Access Provisioning

IAG Groups to get access to AWS IAM roles (Developer/Support, DevOps and Release Management) to support and manage application infrastructure
IAG Groups to get access to Splunk Web console
Local User provisioned by Splunk administrator using Time bound access
Authentication and

Authorization

Integrated with FMSSO for Web UI access to Splunk console for all Splunk components 
AD authentication/authorization for management components console / Web UI ( Tech Debt – requires sending authentication logs → siem )
Splunk HEC Token authentication for Splunk Http Event Collector Log ingestion
Fannie Mae Certs for authentication between splunk components
API authentication by Splunk for MARS process automation ( ?? authentication logs → siem )
Application Security

FM UCD, EC2 COTS automation using CCOE service catalog for infrastructure provisioning, installation and configuration of Splunk application, CCOE Jira Tickets for any resource not supported by default CCOE Service catalog
Same for Splunk version upgrade, patch deployment 
Changes to Splunk configuration will be pushed from bit bucket to deployment Server and via deployment server to other components .
Will leverage IAM Roles for AWS native service integration, STS:AssumeRole for any Cross Account AWS resource access 
IAM Instance Role with default privileges, any additional privileges using STS:AssumeRole trust with other IAM role having required access 
Limited Privileges to Lambda Execution Role (not as instance role)
Security Groups for rules to allow network connectivity between Splunk components. (allowed ports as per )Splunk Components
Search Head
Peer Node (Indexer)
Cluster Master
Deployment Server
Deployer Server
Management Console
Heavy Forwarder
Universal Forwarder (deployed on client instances)
Security Groups for rules to allow network connectivity between Splunk components. (allowed ports table below)
front-ended by NLB and ALB to allow network connectivity from non-splunk resources 
AWS SSM Session manager  to provide ssh access to EC2 instance 
Infrastructure Security

Need Cross Region network access between Splunk Cluster, deployment and other management console over ports 9887, 9997, 8089, and 8088
Amazon S3 shall be accessed via the VPC Gateway Endpoint
Appropriate security groups and network ACLs will be configured to provide perimeter security for the application components 
Micro segmentation gap - requires opening up Cross Region Compute Subnet CIDR block in Security Group to allow splunk instances for cross region connectivity via TGW on ports  9887, 9997, 8089. To ensure data security, all communication will be over TLS 1.2. SSL certificates and Shared keys are used for cross region connection. 
Splunk will be deployed in Logging Account, only applications deployed will be MARS and InfoSec Splunk. (Do we need to open Tech Debt for this)
OS patching -EC2 COTS using CCOE Service catalog
End of life AMI upgrade - work with CCOE to update COTS automation tool to support this feature
Data Security

Data-in-transit:

TLS 1.2  for logs from application endpoints to Splunk 
TLS 1.2  between Splunk components and Pass4SynmKey key (Secret Manager)
Data-at-Rest:

Data in S3 will be encrypted using server-side encryption KMS
EBS volume KMS encrypted
Logging and Monitoring

Authentication logs via FMSSO to SIEM
SSM Session manager logs for ssh /cli activity
AWS CloudTrail AWS CloudWatch will be leveraged for security logging and monitoring activities.
Splunk process and activity logs will be stored in splunk _internal index
Additional logging requirements  - What happens if FMSSO is not enabled AND local/admin user activity- 
Ingest auth logs to SIEM where FMSSO is not enabled
Local user login logs - Splunk service user(local user for automation) not using UI console login 
Splunk Admin user activity during non time-bound interval
Operations Security

Platform support team will support the operations, patch managements and upgrades. Will leverage SSM documents and automation.

Resiliency 

Splunk is a RG0 asset with Active/Active (east-1/east-2) setup. Logs are replicated to east-2.

PSS will be in-charge of switching the destinations for CloudWatch logs (at a global level)  between regions in the event of any regional failure of Splunk platform. CloudWatch regional failure is outside this scope and will adhere to the AWS SLAs.

Single Region Resiliency: Clusters will be deployed across minimum 4 AZs to ensure resiliency within a region. 

Cross Region Resiliency: For all applicable lifecycles, there will be a region 2 in active-active configuration for resiliency across regions.  

Scenario

RTO

RPO

Active-Active	Real time (<5 minutes)	Real time (<0 minutes)
RTO and RPO is just for the Splunk COTS platform. CloudWatch, Kinesis and underlying AWS infrastructure will follow AWS SLAs. 


Guardrails (optional)
Add references to the applicable Architecture Guardrails, such as data guardrails, security guardrails, and enterprise resilience guardrails (for an example, see here).

Anti Patterns ( required )
This pattern should not be used for logs containing sensitive or NPI data. Application teams must mask such information before streaming to CloudWatch/Splunk.

Known Limitations ( required )
Splunk is built on native AWS services (Cloud Watch -> Kinesis), so will have impacts if those AWS services aren’t available.
EC2s rely on parameter store for URLs and other user information during system reboots and upgrades.  
Tech Debt (optional)
Micro segmentation (requires opening up Cross Region Compute Subnet CIDR block in Security Group to allow Splunk instances for cross region connectivity via TGW on ports  9887, 9997, 8089, and 8088)
FMSSO not enable for authentication on Splunk management nodes - Team will work on processes and automation to perform task that require running command from CLI as Federated admin. Splunk 8.1 upgrade supports SAML user in CLI using Authenticator Extension for SAML IDP.
Appendix (optional)
Any other sections, subsections, or external resources that you would like to include. For example:
